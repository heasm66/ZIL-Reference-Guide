# ZIL Reference Guide

The goal is to list all commands in the ZILF developing environment with a short description 
of the command and some short examples to illustrate how the command is used.

This is not meant to be a designer manual but just a reference of the syntax of 
the commands and their usage.

This is a first draft with lots of placeholders at the moment.

The information comes mostly from:
